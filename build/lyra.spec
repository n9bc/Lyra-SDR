"""PyInstaller spec for Lyra-SDR.

Build with:
    pyinstaller --noconfirm build/lyra.spec

Output:
    dist/Lyra/Lyra.exe          ← the executable
    dist/Lyra/...               ← bundled libs + assets
    (folder-mode bundle, NOT one-file — operators can browse the
     install dir, see the help markdown files, copy/edit them; one-
     file mode hides everything inside a temp self-extract which
     makes troubleshooting harder for testers)

Build requirements:
    Windows + Python 3.11+ + pyinstaller>=6.0
    All Lyra runtime requirements satisfied (PySide6, NumPy, SciPy,
    sounddevice, websockets, psutil, nvidia-ml-py, pywin32)
