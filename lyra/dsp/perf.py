"""DSP performance instrumentation — Phase 1a of the GPU-FFT plan.

Why this exists
---------------
Before we can credibly say "GPU FFT is faster than CPU FFT", we need
real measurements from real machines. This module gives us a tiny,
always-on-but-cheap timing primitive that the FFT path (and later, NR
/ demod / etc.) can sprinkle into hot loops to capture:

- per-operation duration (ms)
- EWMA-smoothed average (so the displayed numbers don't jitter)
- min/max over a rolling window (catches transient spikes)
- frame rate (operations per second) the loop is actually hitting

The data feeds a small status-bar overlay (toggled via View menu)
so the operator can SEE what their machine is doing without any
profiler / log-trawling. Testers can screenshot the readout and
attach it to a bug report — that's the baseline data set we'll
compare GPU runs against in Phase 1d.

Design notes
------------
- **Disabled-state cost is one bool check.** The intent is for perf
  instrumentation to ship enabled in dev builds and OFF by default in
  the released installer; operators turn it on via View menu when
  they want to see it. The hot path's overhead when off must be
  effectively zero — a single attribute read.
- **No external deps.** stdlib `time.perf_counter` only. We do NOT
  depend on numpy or psutil here so this module loads cleanly even
  in the most-stripped runtime configurations.
- **Per-name registry.** Multiple call sites (FFT proper, full
  tick, demod, NR, …) each get their own named PerfTimer. The
  registry lets the UI emit a single snapshot dict containing all
  active timers without each site having to wire its own signal.

Future expansions (after Phase 1):
- Per-backend tagging once VulkanFFTBackend lands (so the UI can
  show "FFT (vulkan): 0.3 ms" vs "FFT (numpy): 2.3 ms" side-by-side
  during the A/B comparison phase).
- Histogram export for offline analysis.
