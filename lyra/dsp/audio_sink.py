    Key design choices (documented because they matter for Windows
    audio interfaces, USB multichannel cards, and S/PDIF outputs):

    - **Prefers WASAPI over MME.** PortAudio's system default on
      Windows is MME (20+ years old, flaky with S/PDIF and USB audio
      interfaces, silently drops mono frames on some drivers). We
      explicitly pick the WASAPI host API's default output device
      when the caller didn't specify one. WASAPI is what every
      serious modern audio app on Windows uses (DAWs, SDR clients,
      browsers).

    - **Opens stereo, writes duplicated mono.** The demod chain is
      mono (SSB/CW/AM/FM/DIGU all produce a single audio channel).
      S/PDIF / TOSLINK outputs are rigidly 2-channel and some drivers
      silently drop mono frames instead of auto-duplicating — so we
      always open stereo and duplicate the mono sample into both L
      and R. Harmless on analog outputs (which would have duplicated
      anyway).
