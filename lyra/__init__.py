"""Lyra — Qt6 SDR transceiver for Hermes Lite 2 / 2+.

Version policy
--------------
Pre-1.0 releases use 0.<minor>.<patch> where:
  - <minor> bumps for user-facing feature batches
  - <patch> bumps for bug-fix-only releases between feature batches

The single source of truth is `__version__` below. UI surfaces (title
bar, About dialog, status bar, settings dialog footer) and the install
guide all read from this string — bump it once here per release and
everything else follows automatically.

# Stamped at release time to today's date when packaging the
# Inno Setup installer. During raw-source-tree development this stays
# "dev"; the packaging script rewrites this constant before the
# PyInstaller bundle is frozen, so the About dialog + status bar in
# the released .exe show the date the operator received it.

      `__file__` lives at `<repo>/lyra/__init__.py`, so resources
      are at `<repo>/`. We walk one parent up.

    - **PyInstaller frozen bundle** (`Lyra.exe`):
      PyInstaller sets `sys._MEIPASS` to the bundle directory where
      `datas` were copied. In folder-mode bundles this is
      `<install>/_internal/`; in onefile bundles it's a temp dir.
      Either way, `_MEIPASS / 'docs'` and `_MEIPASS / 'assets'`
      are where our build/lyra.spec puts them.
