"""Radio — central state + I/O controller for Lyra.

The single source of truth for radio state and the orchestrator of the
HL2 stream, DSP pipeline, demods, notches, and audio sink. UI panels
(and the TCI server, later) subscribe to this object's Qt signals and
call its setter methods — they never share state with each other.

This is the architectural seam: panels and controllers read FROM Radio
and push changes TO Radio. Swap the UI layout without touching any DSP
logic; add a TCI bridge by wiring another subscriber to the same signals.

        TEMPERATURE — AD9866 on-die temperature diode. Per the chip

            with a 5.0 V reference and a 22 + 1 ohm / 1.1 ohm

        drove LNA to +44 dB where IMD became audible ("odd mixed
