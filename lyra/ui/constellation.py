"""Lyra panadapter watermark.

Renders a Lyra/lyre constellation image as a faint watermark behind
the spectrum trace, plus a slow pulsing Vega highlight on top of
the chosen star. Operator-toggleable in Settings → Visuals.

Asset: lyra/assets/watermarks/lyra-watermark.jpg — a stylized lyre
silhouette built from constellation stars + connecting lines on a
dark starfield. Loaded once and cached at the current widget size.

Visual treatment:
  - Centered horizontally on the panadapter
  - Vertically scaled to fit ~92% of widget height (preserves aspect)
  - Painted with low overall opacity so the trace dominates
  - Composed with CompositionMode_Plus (additive) so the dark
    background pixels of the source image disappear into the black
    panadapter background — only the bright stars / lines / lyre
    edges actually show through. This avoids the otherwise-visible
    "tinted rectangle" effect of a low-alpha dark-blue overlay.
  - Vega star (one of the bright distinct points in the source
    image) gets a slow sinusoidal pulse glow rendered on top as a
    multi-layer additive blob. Driven by time.monotonic() so it
    animates with the spectrum repaint cadence.

Drawn as the FIRST overlay (under the trace fill, passband, marker,
etc.) so the spectrum line dominates visually.
