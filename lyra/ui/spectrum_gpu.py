"""GPU-accelerated panadapter — Phase A skeleton.

This module is **opt-in** and parallel to `spectrum.py`. The existing
QPainter-based `SpectrumWidget` / `WaterfallWidget` remain the default
production renderers. `SpectrumGpuWidget` is a from-scratch
implementation built directly on Qt's QOpenGLWidget, which gives us
GPU-accelerated rendering through the platform's OpenGL driver
(NVIDIA, AMD, Intel HD/Iris/Arc — all supported).

Design rationale
----------------
We chose QOpenGLWidget over QRhi/Vulkan because:

  - QRhi PySide6 bindings (Qt 6.7+) are still very new — initial
    Phase A.3 attempts hit deep crashes inside Qt's D3D11 backend
    that aren't easily debuggable from Python. See the parked
    `feature/qrhi-panadapter` branch (tag: experiment-qrhi-attempt)
    for the journey.
  - QOpenGLWidget has been in PySide6 for years, has hundreds of
    working examples, and is the path most Qt+Python apps take
    when they need GPU rendering.
  - On Win10/11 with modern GPU drivers, OpenGL Just Works™. If a
    machine's native OpenGL is broken, Qt automatically falls back
    to ANGLE (which translates to D3D11), so we get D3D coverage
    indirectly without writing D3D code.
  - macOS uses Apple's OpenGL implementation (deprecated but still
    functional). Long-term Mac support would migrate to Metal — that's
    a separate project, not a v0.0.5/0.0.6 concern.
  - Vulkan can be revisited later via QRhi if/when PySide6 bindings
    mature, OR if a real performance need arises that OpenGL can't
    handle. Today neither is true.

The Settings → Visuals → Graphics backend combo will gain a third
choice ("OpenGL — GPU-accelerated panadapter"), with the existing
"Software (QPainter)" remaining as the unconditional fallback.
Vulkan stays in the combo as "(future)" — greyed out but visible —
so the operator-facing UI hook is preserved if we ever revisit.

Phase A scope (this file's progress)
------------------------------------
A.2: widget skeleton with shader compile + clear. Proven on the dev
machine.

A.3 (THIS COMMIT): vertex-buffer trace draw with synthetic data.
  - Dynamic VBO sized for MAX_BINS vec2 points
  - VAO that bundles the vertex attribute state (required in 3.3+
    core profile — no default VAO like the legacy compatibility
    profile had)
  - paintGL: bind program + VAO + VBO, upload current trace data
    via QOpenGLBuffer.write(), draw with GL_LINE_STRIP — ONE call
    per frame instead of the per-pixel drawLine loop the QPainter
    widget does
  - Built-in animated sine-wave generator runs until set_spectrum()
    is called, so the widget is self-testing without a Radio
    attached. The standalone demo (Phase A.5) will use the public
    set_spectrum() API; same path Lyra's panel system will use in
    Phase B.
  - 30 Hz repaint timer drives the animation while in synthetic
    mode. Disabled when set_spectrum() takes over.

A.4 will add: streaming-texture waterfall + working draw call
A.5 will add: standalone demo runner (separate file)
A.6 will add: external profile pass

Phase B will integrate into Lyra (Settings UI, real Radio data).
