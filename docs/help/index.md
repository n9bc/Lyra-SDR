# Lyra User Guide

![Lyra SDR](assets/logo/lyra-icon-256.png)

Welcome. Lyra is a Qt-based SDR transceiver for Steve Haynal's
**Hermes Lite 2** and **Hermes Lite 2+** (the "+" adds an AK4951 audio
add-in board with a line-level jack for RX audio and a microphone path
for TX).

This guide lives inside the app — press **F1** anywhere or use
**Help → User Guide** to open it. Pick a topic from the tree on the
left.

The source markdown files are in `docs/help/` in the project folder —
edit them in any editor and hit **Reload** in the help window to pick
up changes.

## Quick start

1. Open **⚙ Settings…** → **Radio** tab, enter your HL2's IP address
   (click **Discover** if you don't know it).
2. Close Settings, click **▶ Start** in the toolbar. The status dot
   should turn green.
3. Click a digit on the main frequency display and scroll the mouse
   wheel to tune — or type a frequency in MHz directly.
4. Right-click the **AGC** cluster on the DSP & AUDIO panel → pick
   **Auto**. The threshold will follow the band noise floor.
5. Pick a mode (LSB / USB / CWL / CWU / AM / FM / DIG) in the
   MODE & FILTER panel.

## License

Lyra is released under the **MIT License**.
See the `LICENSE` file at the project root for the full terms.

Lyra is an independent, clean-room implementation. The code is
not derived from any other SDR client's source. Other established
HL2 client programs are referenced only as protocol cross-checks
during development. If you find anything in Lyra that appears to
copy code from a third-party project, please file an issue so it
can be investigated.

The TCI server protocol implemented by Lyra (Help → Settings →
Network/TCI) was created and is maintained by EESDR Expert
Electronics as an open specification; Lyra implements it from the
public TCI v1.9 / v2.0 documentation.
