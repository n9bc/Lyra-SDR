# Audio Routing

Lyra supports two audio output paths and a layered gain chain
following the standard SDR-client conventions.

## Output sinks

Two output paths are selectable from the **Out** dropdown on the
[DSP & AUDIO panel](panel:dsp), and also from **Settings → Audio**:

| Sink | Where the audio comes out |
|---|---|
| **PC Soundcard** | Your computer's audio output (any selectable device) |
| **AK4951** | The HL2+'s onboard codec line-out jack |

Switching between the two is robust — neither leaks "digitized
robotic" residue from the previous sink, even if you flip rapidly
back and forth.

## Settings → Audio device picker

Under **Settings → Audio** you'll find:

- **Output sink** — same AK4951 / PC Soundcard pick as the front-panel
  dropdown.
- **Output device** — which physical PortAudio device the **PC
  Soundcard** sink uses. Default is **"Auto (WASAPI default)"** which
  picks whatever Windows has set as the default output via the
  WASAPI host API. Override here if your speakers are on a USB audio
  interface, virtual cable, S/PDIF dongle, etc., and Windows's default
  isn't where you want the audio routed.
- **Refresh device list** — re-enumerates PortAudio devices (handy
  after plugging in a new USB sound card without restarting Lyra).

The selection persists across launches via QSettings.

## Why WASAPI (not MME)

Lyra explicitly prefers the **WASAPI** Windows audio API over the
older MME. MME (the system default) is 20+ years old and silently
drops mono frames on S/PDIF / TOSLINK outputs — symptom is "Lyra
opens its audio stream OK but no sound comes out, even though every
other Windows app works fine on the same speakers." WASAPI is what
modern audio apps on Windows use (DAWs, SDR clients, browsers). Lyra
opens stereo and duplicates mono into both channels so the same
audio path works on analog AND digital outputs.

## The gain chain

Every audio sample passes through this chain before reaching your
speakers:

```
demod → AGC (if on) → AF Gain → Volume → tanh limiter → sink
```

Three operator-controlled stages, each with a distinct role:

### LNA — RF input gain

Slider on the DSP + Audio panel, range −12 to +31 dB. Sets the
hardware preamp gain on the HL2's AD9866 ADC. This is "how much
signal hits the digitizer" — set it high enough to bring weak
signals above the ADC noise floor, but not so high that strong
signals push the ADC into clipping. Watch the **ADC peak readout**
on the toolbar (color-coded green = sweet spot, orange = hot, red
= clipping).

The LNA dB readout to the right of the slider is **color-coded**
to reflect the AD9866 PGA's linearity:

| Zone | Range | When to use |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **GREEN — sweet spot** | −12 .. +20 dB | Normal HF operating, contests, anywhere there's any decent signal level. Lowest IMD, cleanest dynamic range. |
| **YELLOW — high gain** | +20 .. +28 dB | Quieter bands (10 m, 6 m), weak-signal modes (FT8/WSPR), low-noise antennas. Watch for IMD on bands with strong adjacent signals. |
| **ORANGE — IMD risk** | +28 .. +31 dB | Only when you really need every dB — e.g. EME, weak meteor scatter, very quiet portable setups. The PGA approaches its compression knee here; nearby strong signals can fold into your passband as ghost products. |

Above +31 dB the AD9866 stops giving usable additional gain and
just compresses the ADC, so Lyra hard-caps the slider at +31. You
**can't** accidentally drive the chip into the unusable region.

#### Auto-LNA — overload protection (back-off only)

The **Auto** button next to the LNA slider enables a back-off-only
control loop:

| ADC peak | Auto action |
|---|---|
| > −3 dBFS  | drop 3 dB (urgent — clipping imminent) |
| > −10 dBFS | drop 2 dB (hot — leave headroom) |
| otherwise  | leave the operator's setting alone |

**It does NOT raise gain** — that's deliberate. You set the baseline
LNA for the band you're on; Auto only kicks in when a transient
strong signal threatens to overload the ADC. When it fires, three
visual cues appear so you can see Auto working:

1. The **slider moves** to the new (lower) gain value.
2. A small amber **"↓2 dB  HH:MM:SS"** badge appears next to the
   Auto button showing the most recent event. Hover for a tooltip
   with the ADC peak that triggered the adjustment.
3. The **slider track briefly flashes amber** (~800 ms) so the eye
   catches the change even if you're not looking right at the
   slider.

If you've enabled Auto and never seen it fire, that means your
antenna isn't delivering signals strong enough to need the
protection — which is the common case under normal HF conditions.
A strong AM broadcast bleed, a nearby contest station, or a quiet
band suddenly opening with a big DX signal are typical triggers.

#### Auto-LNA pull-up — bidirectional mode (opt-in)

Settings → DSP → **Auto-LNA pull-up** (default OFF) promotes the
Auto button from back-off-only to **bidirectional**. With pull-up
on, Auto also *raises* gain when the band has been quiet for a
while — useful for digging weak signals out of the noise on quiet
bands without having to ride the slider yourself.

**How pull-up decides to climb (all must hold):**

| Gate | Threshold |
|---|---|
| RMS over recent window | < −50 dBFS |
| Peak over recent window | < −25 dBFS |
| Sustained-quiet streak | 5 consecutive ticks (~7.5 s) |
| Time since last manual gain change | > 5 s |
| Current LNA gain | < +24 dB (auto soft ceiling) |

When all gates pass, Auto climbs by **+1 dB**. The next tick
re-evaluates from the new gain. Down-steps stay aggressive (2–3
dB), up-steps stay gentle (1 dB) — the loop reacts fast to
overload, slow to opportunity.

**Self-limiting:** every +1 dB of LNA raises the noise floor by
roughly +1 dB. On a typical clean station the climb naturally
halts when RMS crosses −50 dBFS — usually well before the +24 dB
ceiling. The ceiling is just a hard backstop in case noise floor
stays unusually low.

**Manual override always wins.** Touch the slider and pull-up
defers for 5 seconds, then re-evaluates. If you set LNA manually
above +24 dB, Auto won't pull it back down (back-off still will,
on real overload).

**Why it's opt-in:** an earlier Lyra build had a target-chasing
upward loop that drove LNA to +44 dB on 40 m and produced IMD.
The current pull-up uses RMS detection (not peak chasing), a
much lower ceiling, and slow asymmetric stepping — but until
field-tested across a variety of stations, it stays off by
default. Turn it on when you want to try it; turn it off if you
hear odd mixing products on busy bands.

### AF Gain — makeup gain (post-AGC, pre-Volume)

Slider on the DSP + Audio panel, range 0 to +50 dB. Linear (1 tick =
1 dB). This is the "how much do I need to boost weak signals" knob.
Critical for digital modes where AGC is typically off — set AF Gain
to bring weak FT8/RTTY/PSK signals up to listenable levels without
having to crank Volume.

Set this **once** for your station's typical signal level, then
forget. Most operators land around +20 to +40 dB depending on
antenna strength and band.

### Volume — final output trim

Slider on the DSP + Audio panel, range 0 to 100%. Pure trim of the
final output before it hits the speakers. Uses a **perceptual
(quadratic) curve** so each tick yields roughly equal loudness
change — unity gain (full AF-gained signal) sits at 100%, 71% =
−6 dB, 50% = −12 dB, 25% = −24 dB.

This is the moment-to-moment "louder/quieter" knob.

### Mute

Button next to Vol. Multiplies the final output by 0 without
changing the Volume slider position — quick "hold" during a knock
at the door, click again to resume at exactly the volume you set.
Mute state is Radio-side, so TCI volume commands can't accidentally
un-mute you.

### Bal — stereo balance / pan

Slider on the DSP + Audio panel between **Vol** and **Out**. Pans
the (currently mono) audio between the left and right channels
using an equal-power pan law (cos / sin at π/4) — the perceived
loudness stays constant as you sweep across center, instead of
sagging in the middle the way a naive linear pan would.

**Three ways to find center:**

1. **Visible tick marks** below the slider track — five marks at
   L100 / L50 / **C** / R50 / R100. The center mark is where you
   stop for true mono.
2. **Snap-to-center deadzone** — sweeping within ±3% of center
   automatically locks to true zero. Lets you find center without
   pixel-perfect aim.
3. **Click the L37 / C / R12 label** to the right of the slider
   to instantly recenter. Double-clicking the slider track itself
   does the same thing.

**Works on both output sinks:**

- **PC Soundcard** — applied per-channel before stereo write to
  the WASAPI output device.
- **AK4951** — the HL2's onboard codec is a true stereo DAC. The
  EP2 audio frame has separate Left16 / Right16 fields that the
  gateware routes to the AK4951's L/R channels independently. Lyra
  applies the balance gains and feeds proper stereo to both.

**Future expansion (after RX2 ships):** the same Bal slider will
become the RX1 / RX2 mixing control — RX1 to one ear, RX2 to the
other for DX-split listening.

## AGC interactions

AGC sits BEFORE AF Gain in the chain. With AGC **on** (Fast / Med /
Slow / Auto), incoming audio is normalized to a target level
(default −30 dBFS) before AF Gain boosts it further.

With AGC **off** (correct setting for digital modes), AF Gain is
your only level control between demod and Volume — that's what it's
designed for.

Switching AGC on ↔ off produces only a small loudness delta when AF
Gain is sensibly set (the expected SDR-client behavior). If you see a big jump,
either bump AF Gain higher (to bring AGC-off levels closer to
AGC-on) or lower it (to ease back when AGC-on is too loud).

## AK4951 audio requires 48 kHz sample rate

The AK4951 audio path on the HL2+ requires the IQ sample rate to
be exactly **48 kHz**. At higher rates (96 / 192 / 384 kHz) the EP2
audio queue gets drained faster than the 48 kHz demod can fill it,
producing chopped / distorted audio.

Lyra auto-handles this:

- **Above 48 k → auto-switch to PC Soundcard** with a status-bar
  toast. Your AK4951 preference is remembered and restored when
  Rate returns to 48 k.
- **Picking AK4951 above 48 k** drops the rate to 48 k and applies
  AK4951. One click, works.

## RX audio chain on HL2+

```
Antenna → ADC → DDC → EP2 → AK4951 → phones/line jack → (your speakers)
```

Hardware-level latency for monitoring. The PC is still in the loop
for spectrum, decoding, TCI, etc. — only the audio playback path
is offloaded.

## Routing to VAC / virtual cables

Use the **Settings → Audio → Output device** picker. If you have
VB-Cable / Virtual Audio Cable installed, it appears in the device
list (usually under WASAPI host API). Pick it as the output device
and Lyra's audio routes there for JS8Call / WSJT-X / FLDIGI to
consume — no hardware loopback needed.

## Latency

PC Soundcard latency is PortAudio-default, typically 20–50 ms.
AK4951 latency is hardware-only (under 5 ms typical). Tighter
PortAudio latency settings are on the backlog.
