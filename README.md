# Lyra — Qt6 SDR Transceiver for Hermes Lite 2 / 2+

**Current version: 0.0.5 — "Listening Tools"**

Modern PySide6 desktop SDR for Steve Haynal's Hermes Lite 2 and HL2+.
Native Python HPSDR Protocol 1, TCI v1.9 server, glassy UI with
analog-look meters, a band-plan overlay with landmark click-to-tune,
GPU-accelerated panadapter + waterfall, and a CW-focused audio
toolkit (APF audio peaking filter + BIN binaural pseudo-stereo).

## Status

Pre-alpha — RX is functional; TX is in progress. Developed and tested
against a Hermes Lite 2+ board.

The version string above is the single source of truth maintained in
`lyra/__init__.py` and surfaces in:

- The window title bar
- The Help → About Lyra dialog
- A permanent label on the right side of the status bar
- The User Guide's About section (rendered live from package metadata)

Bumping the version is a one-line edit in `lyra/__init__.py`; every
display surface follows automatically.

## What's in 0.0.5 — "Listening Tools"

A meaningful audio-DSP and panadapter release driven by extended
field testing on the operator's HL2+. Two new CW DSP tools, full
GPU panadapter feature parity, an audio chain rebuild that fixes
several long-standing stability issues, and an auto-update check
so testers don't get stranded on old builds.

### New listening tools

- **APF — Audio Peaking Filter (CW)** — narrow peaking biquad
  centered on the operator's CW pitch. Boosts weak CW tones above
  the noise floor without the ringing tail of a brick-wall narrow
  filter. Right-click for BW/Gain quick presets. CW-only (button
  preserved across mode switches but only audibly affects CWU/CWL).
- **BIN — Binaural pseudo-stereo (headphones)** — Hilbert phase
  split puts the audio "in the middle of the head" for spatial CW
  perception and SSB voice widening. Adjustable depth 0–100 %, equal
  loudness normalized. Works on all modes.

### GPU panadapter — full feature parity (BETA)

Everything the QPainter widget does, now on the GPU:
- Band plan overlay (sub-band segments + landmark click-to-tune)
- Peak markers (line / dots / triangles, optional dB readout)
- DX/contest spots with multi-row collision packing + age-fade
- Notch markers, drag-to-resize, right-click menu
- Click-to-tune, Y-axis drag, wheel zoom, RX-BW edge drag
- Passband overlay, noise-floor reference, VFO marker, CW Zero line
- Grid toggle (operator preference)

GPU mode is opt-in via Settings → Visuals → Graphics backend.
Testers should compare against the QPainter backend to validate
parity on their GPU.

### Audio chain rebuild

- **AGC profiles recalibrated** — Fast/Med/Slow release time
  constants were ~20× too slow (audio stayed clamped for many
  seconds after a peak). Retuned to standard SDR-client conventions:
  Fast τ≈120 ms / hang 130 ms, Med τ≈250 ms / hang 0, Slow τ≈500 ms /
  hang 1 s.
- **AGC OFF audibility** — was 14 dB quieter than AGC ON because
  AGC's typical gain (~5×) wasn't compensated. Fixed with a constant
  +14 dB makeup so toggling AGC produces only a slight loudness
  delta as the chain design intended.
- **Mode = Tone hang** — the test-tone generator was producing
  samples at IQ rate (192k) but feeding a 48k sink, causing
  back-pressure → GUI lockup on output swap. Fixed.
- **Audio output rate-sticky bug** — switching between AK4951 and
  PC Soundcard could lock the audio path until rate cycle. Fixed.
- **WWV ↔ FT8 stuck audio** — big freq/mode jumps could leave audio
  silent until rate cycle. Root cause was C&C register staleness;
  fixed with round-robin keepalive at the protocol layer.

### S-meter overhaul

- **LNA-invariant S-meter** — moving the LNA slider no longer
  changes meter reading (matches the operator-set S9 calibration
  point). dBFS → dBm conversion subtracts LNA gain from the raw
  level so the S-meter shows actual antenna signal strength.
- **Auto-LNA pull-up** — opt-in. Auto button now optionally raises
  LNA when the band is sustained-quiet, in addition to the existing
  back-off-on-clipping behavior. Two-tier ceiling (+24 dB on quiet
  bands, +15 dB when passband signal is present) plus a passband
  margin gate keep it out of the IMD zone.

### Other refinements

- **Spot prefixes** — switched from regional-indicator emoji flags
  (Windows can't render them) to plain-text 2-letter ISO codes.
  Spot boxes now show e.g. "US N8SDR" or "JA JA1XYZ" with consistent
  rendering on every platform.
- **Settings → DSP → CW group** — pitch + APF + BIN settings live
  here together (renamed from "CW pitch").
- **Auto-update check on startup** — silent background check of the
  GitHub releases API. If a newer Lyra is published, the operator
  sees a status-bar message and a "🆕 Update available" badge on
  the Help menu's Check for Updates entry.

See the in-app User Guide (F1) for the full APF and BIN topic
docs, plus updated AGC, audio, and spectrum coverage.

## What was in 0.0.4 — "Discovery & Scale Polish"

- **Auto-scale = clamp, not disable** — dragging the dB-range scale
  on the spectrum no longer turns auto-scale OFF. Manual range
  becomes the BOUNDS that auto-scale stays inside.
- **Per-band scale memory** — each band remembers its own scale
  bounds, with sensible factory defaults (160 m bottom-heavy,
  6 m top-heavy) so band-swapping just works.
- **Multi-NIC discovery fix** — auto-discover broadcasts on every
  local network interface in parallel. Fixes the "tester with
  Wi-Fi + Ethernet couldn't find the HL2" failure mode.
- **Help → Network Discovery Probe** — diagnostic dialog with
  per-interface probes and a copy-to-clipboard log.
- **OpenGL upgrade nag** — fixed timing so the suggestion popup
  isn't hidden behind the main window on slow boots.

## What was in 0.0.3 — "First Tester Build"

The first packaged installer release. Notable additions since 0.0.2:

- **True dBFS spectrum calibration** — FFT math fixed so 0 dBFS is a
  full-scale tone; per-rig cal trim slider for known path losses
- **S-meter cal + Peak/Average response mode** — right-click meter
  for one-click "Calibrate to S9 (-73 dBm)" + steady time-averaged
  reading
- **Lit-Arc meter widget** — segmented arc-bar meter with no needle
  (less jittery than analog dial), three modes (S / dBm / AGC)
- **Top-banner toolbar** — large local + UTC clocks, live HL2
  hardware telemetry (T / V), CPU% (matches Task Manager), GPU%
  (NVIDIA via NVML or any vendor via Win32 PDH)
- **Settings backup / import / export + auto-snapshots** — JSON
  snapshot of every preference taken on each launch, last 10 kept;
  one-click rollback via File → Snapshots
- **Layout safeguards** — Lock Panels (Ctrl+L), always-factory
  Reset Panel Layout, sanity check refusing to save degenerate
  layouts on close
- **Click-and-drag spectrum tuning** — pan the panadapter like a
  Google Maps view
- **Fine-zoom slider** + click-the-scale-label gestures
- **Stereo balance slider** with center detentation, working on both
  PC Soundcard and AK4951 outputs
- **HL2 Telemetry Probe** dialog under Help — diagnose firmware-
  variant decode mismatches against your specific HL2

Plus extensive performance work to eliminate spectrum/waterfall
stutter (slider debounce, hidden meter timer pause, waterfall
bilinear smoothing, spectrum FPS press/release pattern).

Requires Python 3.11+ on Windows.

**Quickstart:**

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m lyra.ui.app
```

Or double-click `LYRA.bat`.

**Step-by-step install for non-developer testers:**
see [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md) — covers Python installation, Git
setup, dependency install, common gotchas, and feedback channels.
A printable Word version is also at
[`docs/Lyra-SDR-Install-Guide.docx`](docs/Lyra-SDR-Install-Guide.docx).

On first launch, Lyra tries to discover an HL2 on the local network.
If the board is reachable it'll show up in the connection panel; if
not, check firewall, cabling, and that the HL2 has power. Full
troubleshooting guide in the in-app User Guide (press **F1**).

## Relationship to Thetis / WDSP / openHPSDR

Lyra v0.0.5 and earlier (under MIT) were a clean-room implementation
referencing only protocol documentation and operator-visible UI
behavior — no Thetis source was incorporated.

Starting with v0.0.6 (under GPL v3 or later), Lyra is in full
license compatibility with the openHPSDR ecosystem. Future releases
may directly incorporate or link with GPL'd ham-radio libraries
(notably WDSP for PureSignal, CESSB, and advanced TX). All such
incorporations preserve upstream copyright + GPL terms; see
`NOTICE.md` for ongoing third-party disclosures.

ExpertSDR3 is closed-source commercial software from Expert
Electronics — referenced from published manuals as a design
inspiration only, no code involvement.

## Backlog

Tracked in `docs/backlog.md`. High-priority open items: TX path,
per-band notch memory, neural NR integration, installer for beta
testers.

## License

**GNU General Public License v3.0 or later** — see `LICENSE`.

Lyra was originally released under the MIT License up through
**v0.0.5 ("Listening Tools")**. Starting with v0.0.6, Lyra is
relicensed under **GPL v3 or later** to match the licensing of the
broader openHPSDR / WDSP ecosystem and to enable future integration
with WDSP-based features (PureSignal, CESSB, advanced TX). Past
releases (≤ v0.0.5) remain under their original MIT terms; the
relicense applies only to v0.0.6 and later.

What this means in practice:

- You can use Lyra for any purpose, including commercial use
- You can modify Lyra freely
- You can redistribute Lyra and your modifications — but the result
  must also be GPL v3 (or later), and you must make source available

What it does NOT change:

- Donations are still welcome (PayPal, etc.) — GPL doesn't restrict
  receiving payment for the project
- Operators can run Lyra free of charge, no strings attached
- The complete source remains public on GitHub
