# Lyra — Qt6 SDR Transceiver for Hermes Lite 2 / 2+

Modern PySide6 desktop SDR for Steve Haynal's Hermes Lite 2 and HL2+.
Native Python HPSDR Protocol 1, TCI v1.9 server, glassy UI with
analog-look meters, a band-plan overlay with landmark click-to-tune,
and per-notch cut-depth visualization on the panadapter.

## Status

Pre-alpha — RX is functional; TX is in progress. Developed and tested
against a Hermes Lite 2+ board.

## Features so far

**RX signal chain**
- Native HPSDR P1 discovery + streaming (UDP, port 1024)
- Spectrum-correct panadapter (HL2 baseband mirror correction applied)
- AGC with Fast / Medium / Slow / Auto / Custom profiles
- Per-band auto-LNA (overload-protection mode, capped +31 dB)
- Manual notch filters — multi-notch, per-notch Q, live cut-depth
  visualization on the spectrum
- Spectral-subtraction noise reduction (Light / Medium / Aggressive)
- Noise-floor reference line with auto-threshold feeding AGC
- Passband overlay with draggable edges for live RX BW tweaks
- Peak markers (Line / Dots / Triangles, in-passband only)

**Bands and modes**
- IARU regional band plans (US / R1 / R3 / NONE)
- Colored sub-band segments + FT8 / FT4 / WSPR / PSK landmark
  triangles — click a triangle to tune and switch modes
- SSB (USB/LSB), CW, AM, FM, DIGU / DIGL

**UI**
- Docked-panel workspace (drag to float / tab / reset layout)
- Analog S-meter with LED-bar alternative (right-click to switch)
- Waterfall with eight palettes (Classic / Inferno / Viridis /
  Plasma / Rainbow / Ocean / Night / Grayscale)
- Click-label color picker in Settings → Visuals (text of each field
  painted in that field's current color + bolded for at-a-glance
  configuration view)
- Optional OpenGL rasterization backend so resize/fullscreen doesn't
  pause audio
- Y-axis drag-to-rescale on the spectrum's right edge
- Two-way sync between front-panel View sliders and Settings

**Integration**
- TCI v1.9 server — drives SDRLogger+, DX clusters, CAT clients
- DX spot rendering with age fade and multi-row collision packing
- Per-session notch bank, per-band frequency memory

**Audio out**
- AK4951 (HL2's onboard codec) or PC soundcard
- Automatic fallback when the stream rate exceeds AK4951's 48 kHz

## Stack

- **UI:** PySide6 (Qt6)
- **Protocol:** Native Python HPSDR Protocol 1 (UDP, port 1024)
- **DSP:** NumPy / SciPy (C++ core via pybind11 planned post-RX-stable)
- **Control:** TCI v1.9 server
- **Audio:** sounddevice (portaudio), optional AK4951 passthrough via
  the HL2's EP2 frames
- **Target OS:** Windows-first

## Running from source

Requires Python 3.11+ on Windows.

**Quickstart:**

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m lyra.ui.app
```

Or double-click `LYRA.bat`.

**Step-by-step install for non-developer testers:**
see [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md) — covers Python installation, Git
setup, dependency install, common gotchas, and feedback channels.
A printable Word version is also at
[`docs/Lyra-SDR-Install-Guide.docx`](docs/Lyra-SDR-Install-Guide.docx).

On first launch, Lyra tries to discover an HL2 on the local network.
If the board is reachable it'll show up in the connection panel; if
not, check firewall, cabling, and that the HL2 has power. Full
troubleshooting guide in the in-app User Guide (press **F1**).
